# Artist's statement

For project 1 I decided to choose one of my favorite movies of all times which is Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro (2006).
The story takes place a few years after the Spanish civil war and intertwines the real world with a mythical world through the main character Ofelia.
Ultimately to she is a fae princess and must access her kingdom. However, the mythical creature Pan tells her that she must complete three main tasks that she must complete in order to get to her kingdom.
I decided to only focus on these three tasks and created them as mini games that the user must pass in order to help Ofelia achieve her goal.

In the first game, toadGame, Ofelia must throw three magic stones at the toad. Once succeeded, the toad will throw up a key that she will use in the next task.
For toadGame, I decided to challenge myself and use p5.play which I have never used before. I would say that the most difficult/confusing part was making sure my sprites were functional.

The following task, chestGame, Ofelia must unlock the correct chest that hold the dagger for the last task.
For chestGame, I decided to use ml5 and have the player use their index finger to guide the key over which ever chest they would like to unlock. The most challenging part of coding this bit was the fact that my laptop tends to be very laggy when using ml5. I spent a lot of time in the computation lab with Sabine working over how to implement chestGame without lagging the rest of my project.

For the last task, sacrificeGame, Ofelia must provide Pan with a sacrifice and he requests her baby brother. I originally wanted to create two buttons, one that would have said, "Yes, stab my baby brother" and another one that would have said, "No, Stab myself". Unfortunately, I was running out of time, and couldn't exactly figure out how to implement two buttons. I decided to go with a plan B and just have the user click the mouse to "stab" the baby but, as revealed in the final state it actually stabs Ofelia.

I also would have like to implement the lullaby sounds that is in the assets and have it play throughout the entire game. Again, I ran out of time and decided to go without it.
